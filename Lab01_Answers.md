6. Return to your user's home directory: cd ~
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: touch test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: mv test.txt DirA/
9. Contents of `test.txt`: 
echo "Put your words here" > DirA/test.txt
cat DirA/test.txt
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: cp DirA/test.txt DirA/copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`: ls -la DirA
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: cp DirA/test.txt "Dir B"/fodder.txt
